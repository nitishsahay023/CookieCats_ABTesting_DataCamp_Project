================

This is the R version of the project [Mobile Games A/B Testing with
Cookie Cats](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184). The project is
originally provided in the an interactive jupiter notebook, I just
wanted to check how fast I can replicate it in R.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
```
